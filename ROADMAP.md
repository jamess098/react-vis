# Roadmap

This document will be updated with the middle-term ambition for React-vis. 

## Current priority

Right now the priority is to get React-Vis healthy and bug free while addressing as many open issues as possible.

These efforts are essentially focused towards what we consider the core of react-vis: AbstractSeries, ArcSeries, AreaSeries, AxisUtils, ContinuousColorLegend, ContinuousSizeLegend, Crosshair, DiscreteColorLegend, GridLines, Hint, HorizontalBarSeries, HorizontalGridLines, LabelSeries, LineSeries, MarkSeries, RadialChart, ScaleUtils, SearchableDiscreteColorLegend, VerticalBarSeries, VerticalGridLines, XAxis, XYPlot and YAxis.
